            <p>Hello, my name is Tundun. I was born and raised in Nigeria and moved to Cleveland when i was 17 years old. I am currently enrolled in a full-stack coding program at Case Western Reserve University while working fulltime at Lasership. <br> <br> I majored in political science and computer science in undergrad. My motto in life is 'create opportunities out of difficulties'. I enjoy watching basketball, hoarding books, hiking, cooking and travelling to different parts of the world. <br> <br> I have a 17 pound dog named Tank who is very protective of his toys and loves night time cuddles. My main priority is to become a better developer and enjoy every part of the journey. <br> <br> </p>
